# More Geodes

Adds some extra geodes to the Minecraft Caves & Cliffs Update. 

## Emerald Geodes
Emerald geodes behave very similarly to amethyst geodes; they spawn as sphere-like objects underground encased in calcite and smooth basalt casings underground and can grow emerald crystal buds. When these buds are harvested, they of course drop emeralds. Provides an automate-able alternative to emerald farming than just trading endlessly. 

## Quartz Geodes
Quartz geodes are currently WIP. Checkout the `quartz-geodes` branch to see the current progress. Tentatively, they will spawn in The Nether and drop quartz when harvested. Additional functionality may be provided.
