Adds some extra geodes to the Minecraft Caves & Cliffs Update. 

## Emerald Geodes
Emerald geodes behave very similarly to amethyst geodes; they spawn as sphere-like objects underground encased in calcite and smooth basalt casings underground and can grow emerald crystal buds. When these buds are harvested, they of course drop emeralds. Provides an automate-able alternative to emerald farming than just trading endlessly. 

## Quartz Geodes
Quartz Geodes have many similarities to amethyst geodes and emerald geodes. Quartz buds and clusters grow on budding quartz, but budding quartz cannot be harvested. Quartz clusters will drop quartz when broken, but will drop an item form of itself when broken with silk touch, etc. However, quartz geodes spawn exclusively in The Nether, and with a middle layer of tuff instead of calcite. 

### Quartz Buds and Clusters
Quartz buds and clusters behave as an oscillator when powered by an external redstone source. That is, when a bud or cluster receives power, it will periodically turn on and off itself, emitting redstone power on an infinitely-repeating basis. The frequency at which it pulses is determined by its size. 

Buds pulse with the following frequencies:

| Block             | Frequency (Hz) |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Small Quartz Bud  | 0.5 Hz         |
| Medium Quartz Bud | 1 Hz           |
| Large Quartz Bud  | 2 Hz           |
| Quartz Cluster    | 10 Hz          |
